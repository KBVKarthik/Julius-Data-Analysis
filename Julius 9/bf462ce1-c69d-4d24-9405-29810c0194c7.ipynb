    "1. Champion Performance Distribution:\n",
    "- The winrate distribution shows most champions cluster around 50-60%\n",
    "- KDA values typically range between 2-6, with some outliers performing exceptionally well\n",
    "- Champion presence varies widely, with some champions being highly contested (80-100% presence) while others see minimal play\n",

    "{outputs_dict['363b5882']}\n",
    "{outputs_dict['4f32d8e0']}\n",
    "- Kalista and Aurora are showing exceptional performance with >75% winrate\n",
    "- Yone stands out with both high winrate (72%) and significant pick rate (18 games)\n",

    "3. Most Picked Champions:\n",
    "{outputs_dict['efac3f79']}\n",
    "{outputs_dict['3df80c0a']}\n",
    "- Rell is the most picked champion with 26 picks\n",
    "- Most frequently picked champions maintain decent winrates above 50%\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Correlations (from the heatmap):\n",
    "- Strong positive correlation between GPM (Gold Per Minute) and DPM (Damage Per Minute)\n",
    "- Gold difference at 15 minutes (GD@15) strongly correlates with CS difference (CSD@15)\n",
    "- KDA shows moderate positive correlation with damage output metrics\n",

    "- The data suggests a balanced meta where highly picked champions don't necessarily dominate in terms of winrate\n",
    "- Support champions (like Rell, Leona) are highly valued in the current meta\n",
    "- Carry champions (Yone, Kalista) show strong performance when picked\n",
