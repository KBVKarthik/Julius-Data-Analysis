    "Based on the analysis, here are the key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Income Distribution:\n",
    "- Shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating that while most people have moderate incomes, there are some high-income outliers\n",
    "- The majority of the population falls in the middle-income bracket\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Age Distribution:\n",
    "- The age distribution appears to be roughly normal\n",
    "- Most individuals in the dataset are between 30-50 years old\n",
    "\n",
    "3. City Tier Distribution:\n",
    "- There's a relatively even distribution across different city tiers\n",
    "- This suggests a good representation of various urban categories in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Expenses and Savings:\n",
    "{outputs_dict['55f289d3']}\n",
    "{outputs_dict['62f6430e']}\n",
    "{outputs_dict['80b0d258']}\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Findings:\n",
    "- There's a very strong positive correlation (0.94) between Income and Desired Savings\n",
    "- Rent and Groceries are the highest expense categories\n",
    "- The average desired savings percentage is around 9.8% of income\n",
    "- The average disposable income is substantial, indicating potential for increased savings\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "1. Higher income individuals have more savings potential, suggesting targeted financial planning services\n",
    "2. There's room for optimization in major expense categories (Rent and Groceries)\n",
    "3. Different strategies might be needed for different city tiers due to varying cost structures\n",
